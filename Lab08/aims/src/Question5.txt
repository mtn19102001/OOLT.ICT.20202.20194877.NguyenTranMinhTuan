1) If toString() has not been overriden yet:
In this case, the toString() method returns the string representation of the object so
if I want to output this value I may write, for example, System.out.println(something.toString()).
Because this statement will output the hashcode values of the objects, if I want to print out the 
values wanted I have to implement the desired output in the toString() method by overriding it.

2) If toString() has been overriden:
System.out.println(something.toString()) will output the values wanted.

In the previous exercises, we have to override the equals() method,
which is used in another method (contains() for example) and for the toString() method, it will be used directly
