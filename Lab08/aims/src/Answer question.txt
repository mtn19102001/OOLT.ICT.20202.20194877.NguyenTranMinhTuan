1.1. 
   Compare the arbitrary arguments for dvd to array parameter,
I prefer the arbitrary arguments more. 
2. 
   Java is a pass by value programming language
   After the call of swap(jungleDVD, cinderellaDVD), the title 
of these two objects still remain because the swap method is 
essentially changing the values in two pieces of memory. 
Anything referencing those bits of memory will now get different values.
In Java there aren't really pointers, so this won't work.
Instead, we change the stuff inside the object by the changeTitle method,
which set the new title for the dvd.
